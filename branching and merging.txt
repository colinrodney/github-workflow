David Mahler - Intro to Git: Branching and MERGING
1. Work on a git repo

  - Use standard git workflow:
    1) add > 2) commit > 3) push

  - To copy file content from one file to another use command: 
    'cp' --> syntax: cp <first fileName> <new fileName>

2. Define branches  

  A. What is a branch for? (@2:32)
    1. Branches allow us to work on different versions of the same file in parallel. 

    2. Branches result in seprate versions of the same file.

    NOTE: git automatically creates your first branch named 'master' or 'main'.

  B. How is a branch implemented?
    - Branches are POINTERS to a sha1 hash (otherwise known as a commit). In layman terms, branches point to commits in git.

    - As long as we remain on the same branch each time a change/ commit is made, the branch moves up and follows the commits/ changes being made. (ie the branch stays at the tip of our work).

    - Git knows what branch we are on by using a special POINTER named HEAD.

3. Understanding HEAD (@ 3:48)
  1. What is HEAD?
    a. A pointer that normally points to a branch. [ branches > commits and HEAD > branch]

    b. Sometimes called a "symbolic pointer" since it usually points to a branch and not a commit.

    c. In git terminology - the HEAD pointer lets us know what branch is currently checked-out (the branch that is checked-out is the branch you are CURRENTLY on).

  2. How to Create new branches (@ 5:03)
    a. command: 'git branch <branchName>
      1. Makes a new branch w/ the specified filename in git.

      2. New branches are instantiated at the same location as the HEAD pointer.

        ex: git branch index --> makes a branch in git named 'index'

      3. To see all branches in a a repository use command:
        'git branch'
          1. Shows a list of all branches in a repository

          2. The asterisk (*) indicates which branch we are on AND the current branch name will be green. This also represents the currently checked-out branch. More specifically, this means the HEAD pointer is currently pointing to this branch.
